# Migrate App

*Humanize Ridesharing*

## Objectives

- Empower drivers to make more effective use of our multi-person vehicles, **without the tech middle-man.**
  - Migrate stems from the idea that an open-source solutions are usually the best solutions due to the fact that they are a product by the community - for the community.
    Realizing this, Migrate aims to be the open-source ride-sharing app for both Drivers and Riders, and will always prioritize the humanity of the people that use the app over profit-margins.
  - One of Migrate's primary goals is to formulate a profit-model that only makes the money needed to run the app and maintain it's software.
    Migrate will never profit from selling user data or user impressions (advertisements), and should instead only make money from a flat service-rate applied to all rides.
- Return respect to the ride-app contractors by **putting drivers in-charge of their own pricing model.**
  - Drivers set their **rate ($/mile)**
    - 'Minimum-driving-rates' will need to be set regionally to protect our drivers' rights to make a livable wage.
    - 'Average-comparable-rate' should be presented to drivers to help them set their rate.
    - 'High-traffic-pricing' to increase driver pay in areas experiencing high-volume of riders/traffic that make driving more taxing for drivers.
  - Offer drivers additional revenue streams by selling **additional comfort options for riders.**
    - Ride-addons (or 'RiderXtras') are opt-in driver offerings (such as stereo sharing, ad free media services, baggage space, surplus-seating, additional-stops, etc.).
    - RiderXtras will need to have some standards, so that riders can expect a similar service every time they purchase an addon.
- Possibly offer long distance ride-sharing **without compromising ride comfort** by matching drivers & users along their **preferences.**
  - PreferenceTopics: Conversation, Media, Smoking, Vaping, Food&Drinks, etc.
  - Preferences is set to one of three values: (PreferNot | NoPreference | Prefer) along each topic
    - PreferNot: should not match with users who prefer topic.
    - NoPreference: the user is indifferent to topic.
    - Prefer: should match with users who prefer topic.
  - Riders will make a RiderPost regarding a ride they are looking to make.
    - Rider's should be able to set preferences for each RideXtra they are looking to be offered during their trip.
    - Active drivers will be presented the RiderPost, along with a preference breakdown/overlap in driver/rider preferences.
    - Driver's will then accept a ride, and riders will be notified their ride was accepted, and the offered RiderXtras they can confirm.
- Foster a more human experience by not allowing **any soliciting of outside products & services.**
  - Advertisements during audio-media is alright, though drivers are encouraged to skip/mute them.
